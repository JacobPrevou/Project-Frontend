            of mixed martial arts, I wanted to create a resource that allows users
            to search through a complete list of UFC athletes, past and present, who
            can be found on the "Fighters Page". There you will find each UFC fighter's
            stats, from significant strikes to takedown averages. On the "Favorite Fighters List"
            page is a list of user-submitted fighters who stand out among the rest. To 
            add a fighter to the list, simply navigate to the "Add Fighter Form",supply
            the prompted information, and click!
